# ReduxPlayground
This repository incorporates the basics of Redux, including actions, reducers, binding both to React components, and just general monkey-business! 

It features a counter, Hero-list itemizer (shout out to Brandon Sanderson), current Hero clicker, and a section that interacts with OMDB's API via Axios.
